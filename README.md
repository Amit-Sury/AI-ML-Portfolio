## 📂 Projects

### 1. [CNN](./CNN)
- **Goal**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies images of Dog, Horse, and Elephant.  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Highlights**:
  - Trained on a dataset of 3,900 images (1,300 each of Dog, Elephant, Horse) with an additional 450 images for validation. Dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).  
  - Applied preprocessing and data augmentation (rotation, flipping, normalization) to improve model generalization.  
  - Leveraged **AWS SageMaker Script Mode** for custom training, packaging dependencies, and handling deployment.  
  - Deployed the model on **AWS SageMaker** for inference. 
- **Demo/Notebook**: [Link to Jupyter Notebook](./CNN/Notebook/cnn-tensorflow-sagemaker.ipynb)
